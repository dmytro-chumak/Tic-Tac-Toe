## Description

This project presents an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports two players who take turns making moves by placing ‘X’ or ‘O’ symbols on a 3x3 field. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of three identical symbols.

## Functionality

- Interactivity: Players can take turns clicking on the field cells to make a move.
- Winner Determination: The game automatically determines the winner when one of the players makes three consecutive symbols, or declares a draw if all the cells are filled and no one wins.
- Animation and style: The message about the result of the game is displayed smoothly using CSS animations.
- Game restart: The game automatically restarts when you click on the result message.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Starlex02/Tic-Tac-Toe.git```
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.

## Technologies used

- HTML: To create the basic structure of the game.
- CSS: For styling the playing field and implementing animations.
- JavaScript: For processing the game logic, including determining the winner and user interaction.
